>
> **[https://github.com/P3TERX/GeoLite.mmdb/releases](https://github.com/P3TERX/GeoLite.mmdb/releases)**

FROM THE LATEST RELEASE, DOWNLOAD THE FOLLOWING TWO FILES:
* `GEOLITE2-CITY.MMDB` (FOR LOCATION DETECTION)
* `GEOLITE2-ASN.MMDB` (FOR SERVICE PROVIDER DETECTION)

---

### **STEP 4: PROJECT FOLDER LAYOUT**

PLACE THE TWO DOWNLOADED DATABASE FILES IN THE **EXACT SAME FOLDER** AS THE MAIN PYTHON SCRIPT (`DNS-CHECK.py`).

---

## üöÄ RUNNING THE APPLICATION

AFTER COMPLETING THE SETUP, YOU CAN RUN THE APPLICATION IN ONE OF THE FOLLOWING TWO WAYS:

### **METHOD 1: RUNNING VIA COMMAND (RECOMMENDED)**
RUN THE SCRIPT FROM YOUR TERMINAL OR CMD. THIS METHOD ALLOWS YOU TO SEE POTENTIAL ERRORS IN THE CMD WINDOW.
